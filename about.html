            <h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
            <p>TechCon was founded in 1995 by visionary entrepreneur Sarah Donovan in Silicon Valley. Originally known as "TechConnect," the company aimed to bridge the gap between budding technologists and industry giants. Sarah's mission was to create an ecosystem where innovation thrived through collaboration. The company's first event, TechCon ‘95, brought together 200 attendees, primarily software engineers, startup founders, and venture capitalists.

                The inaugural conference was a modest success, featuring panel discussions, networking sessions, and the first-ever "Tech Demo Hour," where startups showcased prototypes to investors. The overwhelming positive feedback inspired Sarah to host the event annually, evolving it into something much larger.</p>
